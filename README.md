# Projects
* Every year since 1947, representatives of UN member states gather at 
the annual sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. The centerpiece of each session is the General Debate. 
This is a forum at which leaders and other senior officials deliver statements that present their government’s perspective on 
the major issues in world politics. These statements are akin to the annual legislative state-of-the-union addresses
in domestic politics. The dataset, the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), includes the corpus of texts of General Debate
statements from 1970 (Session 25) to 2016 (Session 71).  

* The goals of this project are to:

* 1.	Find out most discussed issues by each country.

Topics discussed throughout the years give a general overview of member countries socio-economic climatic overview. 
They are a good indicator of their (member countries) political and economic infrastructure throughout the years. 
A line graph for each member country and specific topics will indicate the popularity of a topic over the years. 

* 2.	Explore similarity in interests of various countries.
Exploring similarity in interests of various countries can be inferred from finding the most discussed issues by each country, 
which will be determined by a created dictionary of “possible issues discussed by the UN”. For accuracy purposes (to ensure 
that the dictionary reflects the discussed topics), a comparison of the word total word count to the issues highlighted will
be surveyed.Creating visualized presentations in the form of bar graphs, pie charts and Venn graphs will be sufficient 
for relational analysis.


* 3.	How does latitude position of each country affect sentiment?
Geographical positions of the member countries are mostly determinant of issues raised by member countries. 
It will be interesting to not only find similarity in topics discussed by countries that fall in the same geographical
region (latitudinally and longitudinally) but to also analyze the sentiment of that specific geographical region. 
Sentiment analysis will include inferring whether  positive or negative outlooks are applied to the  issues raised. 
Again, a relevant visual representation will be presented in the form of line graphs.
