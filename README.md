Abstract

* Every year since 1947, representatives of UN member states gather at the annual sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. 
* The centerpiece of each session is the General Debate. This is a forum at which leaders and other senior officials deliver statements that present their government’s perspective on the major issues in world politics. These statements are akin to the annual legislative state-of-the-union addresses in domestic politics. The dataset, the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), includes the corpus of texts pertaining  to the General Debate statements from 1970 (Session 25) to 2016 (Session 71). It was uploaded to the Kaggle website by the UN organization. It includes the text of each country’s statement from the general debate, separated by country, session and year and tagged for each.
* This dataset includes over forty years of data from different countries, which allows for the exploration of differences between countries over time. This allows to ask both country-specific and longitudinal questions. In exploring the general structure of data of this dataset, I attempt to generate insights into the UN member countries 

Strategy
* Explore similarity in interests of African countries.
* Topic distribution over the years. 
* Sentiment analysis of the African continent.
*  To accomplish these goals, well-known machine learning and text analytics techniques will be using, including LDA (Latent Dirichlet Analysis), word frequency and term co-occurrence along with other visualization techniques.
